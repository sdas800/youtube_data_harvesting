# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing using SQL and Streamlit
## Set up a Streamlit app: 
Streamlit is a great choice for building data visualization and analysis tools quickly and easily. You can use Streamlit to create a simple UI where users can enter a YouTube channel ID, view the channel details, and select channels to migrate to the data warehouse.
## Connect to the YouTube API: 
You'll need to use the YouTube API to retrieve channel and video data. You can use the Google API client library for Python to make requests to the API.
## Store and Clean data : 
Once you retrieve the data from the YouTube API, store it in a suitable format for temporary storage before migrating to the data warehouse. You can use pandas DataFrames or other in-memory data structures.
Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse: 
## After you've collected data for multiple channels, you can migrate it to a SQL data warehouse. You can use a SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for this.
## Query the SQL data warehouse: 
You can use SQL queries to join the tables in the SQL data warehouse and retrieve data for specific channels based on user input. You can use a Python SQL library such as SQLAlchemy to interact with the SQL database.
## Display data in the Streamlit app: 
Finally, you can display the retrieved data in the Streamlit app. You can use Streamlit's data visualization features to create charts and graphs to help users analyze the data.
